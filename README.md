## Updating Data

To update the dashboard with new data:

2. Update the relevant metrics in the `dashboardData` object

The dashboard will automatically reflect the new data.

## Data Sources

## Golden Rules (from CLAUDE.md)

1. NEVER compare GOV conversion rates week-over-week
2. NEVER report GOV conversion rates on <90 day windows
3. ALWAYS filter out MCL, OFV, Others, Ocean Freight Visibility
4. ALWAYS show numerator AND denominator for percentages

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| `Alt + ←` | Previous section |
| `Alt + →` | Next section |
| `Ctrl + D` | Toggle dark mode |
